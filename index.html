                <h1>Dear Shreya,</h1>

                <p>I see how hard you've been working, and I know how much you were hoping for
                    that SAT Audit opportunity. I'm really sorry it didn't work out. I know it's
                    tough, and it's okay to feel disappointed. But here's the thing, there are so
                    many more amazing opportunities waiting for someone as brilliant and talented as
                    you. Seriously, you've got this!</p>

                <p>I've never met anyone as smart and hardworking as you. Every day, you juggle
                    so much and still manage to shine. You're like a superhero, tackling everything
                    that comes your way with grace and determination. I hope you realize just how
                    amazing you are.
                </p>

                <p>I know you were really excited about this chance for new experiences and
                    challenges. It's tough when things don't go the way we hoped, but it doesn't
                    mean it's the end of the road. You've got everything it takes to reach your
                    dreams, and I have no doubt you'll get there.</p>

                <p>So, chin up, my darling. You're going to be just fine, and everything will
                    fall into place, I promise. Keep that beautiful smile of yours shining, for
                    brighter days are on the horizon.</p>
                <footer>With all my love,
                    <br>Your Humourest</footer>
